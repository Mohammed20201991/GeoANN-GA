## Overview

**GeoANN-GA** is a lightweight yet powerful predictive modeling project that combines **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** with **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to predict **soil collapse potential**. This hybrid approach optimizes ANN weights and hyperparameters using GA, enabling robust predictions even with complex, nonlinear geotechnical datasets.

This repository is designed for researchers, engineers, and data scientists working in geotechnical engineering and soil mechanics.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid ANN + GA** approach for optimized predictive performance
- **4-fold Cross-Validation** for robust evaluation
- **GPU Support** for faster training
- **Interactive Visualizations** for model performance and feature impact
- **Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE)** analysis
- Model saving & loading for reproducibility
